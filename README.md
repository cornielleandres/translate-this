# Translate This!

A native app where you can take a picture of something and have the object in the picture translated into the language of your choice and even have a pronunciation provided.

Choose a language. Point your camera at an object and take a picture. AI is used to visually recognize what is in the image. The guesses the AI makes are then translated into your chosen language.

Afterwards, you can click on the translated term and get an auditory pronunciation of the word in its native tongue.
